"As for the Rus, they live on an island … that takes three days to walk round and is covered with thick undergrowth and forests; … They harry the Slavs, using ships to reach them; they carry them off as slaves and … sell them. They have no fields but simply live on what they get from the Slav's lands … When a son is born, the father will go up to the newborn baby, sword in hand; throwing it down, he says, 'I shall not leave you with any property: You have only what you can provide with this weapon.'"


I never told Cato this one. 

My people, the ancient people of the north, when a son was born, the father tossed his sword on the ground before him and said, "I shall leave you no lands, no property, all you will have will be won with this weapon".  

He pulled a hand gun from his jacket and tossed it on the grave.
